# 🔍 Fake Account Detection System  

A **Machine Learning and Deep Learning-powered system** designed to **detect fake social media profiles** in real time by analyzing metadata, activity patterns, and content authenticity. This system can be integrated with social media platforms via a **REST API** for automated detection.  

---

## 📌 Features  

- ✅ **Fake Account Scoring** – Assigns a probability score to indicate the likelihood of being fake.  
- ✅ **Metadata Analysis** – Examines account creation date, friend connections, profile picture, etc.  
- ✅ **Activity Pattern Detection** – Monitors post frequency, engagement levels, and interactions.  
- ✅ **Content Authenticity Check** – Uses AI to detect inconsistencies in images, descriptions, and bios.  
- ✅ **REST API Integration** – Allows external platforms to send data and receive real-time results.  
- ✅ **Real-time Processing** – Uses **Next.js frontend** and **Express.js backend** for seamless performance.  
- ✅ **Database Storage** – Maintains historical analysis data using **MongoDB**.  
- ✅ **User-friendly Interface** – Intuitive UI for users to check profile legitimacy.
